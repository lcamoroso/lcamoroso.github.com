				<h1>What is Connected?</h1>
				<p>Connected is the third piece of the puzzle to assume that your children are making as much progress as possible with Connect.

				<h1>How does Connected work?</h1>
				<p>Connected takes data from the Connect game such as amount of time spent on activities, number of children interacted with, and many other things. It then takes this information and breaks it down into easy to read charts that allow you to track your child’s progress. It alerts you when your child has reached milestones and instructs you on what you can do to keep up the learning. Connected generates personalized rewards for your child that you can print to encourage future milestones. As your child begins to learn and develop Connected alerts you when your childs level can be upgraded.  </p>
